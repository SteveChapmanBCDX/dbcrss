  <p style="text-align: center"><strong>This website is being retired.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 2, 2019</p>
  <p>In response to feedback from users downloading data through the <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset?download_audience=Public" target="_blank">BC Data Catalogue</a> and
    <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/data/geographic-data-services/web-based-mapping/imapbc" target="_blank">iMapBC</a>, we have replaced references to this website with a <q>shopping cart</q> build directly into
    the BC Data Catalogue and iMapBC.</p>

  <p><strong>Why is this being done?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>The technical underpinnings of the Data Distribution Service standalone user interface
      have reached their end of life cycle and continuing to support the existing interface would have
      meant that we could not make much-asked-for enhancements to associated components.
      By retiring the old system, we will be able to upgrade the new BC Data
      Catalogue and iMapBC components to include several bug fixes. We will also be introducing
      a Data Download API.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>When will this happen?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will be retiring the current Data Distribution Service on <strong>July 19, 2019</strong>. </li>
    <li>On <strong>August 5, 2019</strong>, we will be further upgrading the system used in the BC Data
      Catalogue and iMapBC, removing several bugs. At this time, we will also be making
      available a Data Distribution API.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What action is required?</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>For instructions about using the new custom data download interface, visit <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/2acaf193-5b88-462c-ae96-3a3628bd0e2b/resource/035cb473-656c-4bd2-9e56-6735ab5faff0/download/instructions-for-custom-data-downloads.pdf" target="_blank">BC
      Catalogue Instructions for Custom Data Downloads</a> and the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkui5GQzB3E&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Downloading data
      from within iMapBC</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Any question or requests for assistance can be directed to <strong>data@gov.bc.ca</strong>.</p>
  <p>We look forward to continuing to improve your DataBC data experience.</p>
